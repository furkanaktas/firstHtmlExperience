<h2><center><b>GRACE MURRAY HOPPER</b></center></h2>
 Grace Hopper was an american scientist,computer scientist,mathematician and rear admiral.She was a scientist who was first programmer of “Hardvard Mark 1” computer and devolopped first compiler for computer programming languages.She was one of the first users of cleaning concept of the program error known as “debugging”. Also she was one of the developers of “COBOL” which was one of the first modern programming languages.

<h4><b>Cobol</b></h4>
 Hopper supported that programming languages should be closer to the English language instead of a machine language. Towards the end of 1950s,she started working on COBOL which was one of the first modern programming languages with computer experts.She led to develop FORTRAN and COBOL standards and tested these standards.In 1980s,these tests were accepted by ISO (International Organization for Standardization).She was promoted to major-general because of her successes and was retired in 1986.She got outstanding service awards at ceremony which was arranged in Boston.She worked in Digital Equipment company until rest of  her life and she closed her eyes to life on january 1 in 1992.
